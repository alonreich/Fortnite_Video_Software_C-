REDUNDANT CODE FINDER — WRITES TWO REPORTS. READ THE RIGHT ONE.

   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  AI AGENT?  READ  developer_tools/redundant_code_report.jsonl   — AND NOTHING ELSE.    │
   │  HUMAN?     OPEN  developer_tools/redundant_code_report.html    in a browser.          │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

⚠️ AGENTS: DO NOT OPEN THE .html. It is ~5.5x larger and every extra byte is styling, colour and
a SECOND FULL COPY of code you can already read from disk. It exists so a person can review
findings visually. Reading it wastes context and tells you nothing the .jsonl does not.

THE .jsonl IN ONE PARAGRAPH: line 1 is a header holding the run's settings and a `files` array;
every later line is one finding. Parse with `for line in f: json.loads(line)`. A finding gives
a similarity score and two coordinates — file index, first line, last line. Open those ranges
yourself; the code is on disk and is deliberately NOT duplicated into the report.

Both reports are deleted and rewritten on every run, so whatever is on disk is always current.

# (4) WHAT COUNTS AS "LOGIC" — AND WHY THE OLD TEST LET DATA THROUGH.
#
# The old test joined the whole normalised block into one string and asked `if token in text`.
# Two things made that far too generous:
#   * `<` and `>` were treated as comparisons. In C# they are almost always GENERICS —
#     `IReadOnlyList<CoachStep>` scores as logic — so any block declaring a typed collection
#     qualified.
#   * a bare `=` was treated as logic, but `=` is how every field, property and array literal
#     is written, so plain data qualified too.
# Between them, matches #2, #3 and #4 of the last run were all CoachTours.cs — lists of
# `new CoachStep("text", "text")`. That is duplicated DATA, which is not what this tool is for.
#
# The new rule, checked against exact TOKENS rather than substrings:
#   a block is logic if it contains a control-flow WORD, or a real multi-character OPERATOR.
# A lone `=`, and bare `<` / `>`, deliberately do NOT qualify.

# (5) A later match is hidden only when THIS much of BOTH its sides was already reported.
OVERLAP_SUPPRESS_RATIO = 0.60

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FUZZY MATCHING — "these two blocks are ~85% the same", not just "identical".
#
# THE PROBLEM WITH EXACT-ONLY. Growth used to stop dead at the first line whose shape differed.
# Two 40-line blocks that are identical EXCEPT one line in the middle were therefore reported as
# two short matches — or, if either half fell under the 6-line floor, as nothing at all. The tool
# under-reported exactly the near-copies a human most wants to see.
#
# WHAT HAPPENS NOW. A match still has to START on a solid seed of SEED_LINES identical lines —
# that seed is what makes the search fast, because identical seeds can be found with a hash
# lookup instead of comparing everything to everything. From that seed the block grows in BOTH
# directions, and a differing line no longer stops it: it is counted as a miss and growth
# continues, as long as
#     (a) the running score  matched / total  never falls below MIN_SIMILARITY, and
#     (b) no more than MAX_CONSECUTIVE_GAP differing lines appear back to back.
# Rule (b) is what stops two unrelated regions being welded together by a long shared tail.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT SEE. Two blocks that are 85% alike but never share SEED_LINES
# identical lines in a row are invisible, because nothing seeds them. Catching those needs
# all-pairs alignment, which is orders of magnitude slower. This is a deliberate trade.
#
# ⚠️ SUBSTITUTIONS ONLY, NOT INSERTIONS. The two sides advance in lockstep, so a block with an
# extra line inserted on ONE side scores badly from that point on. Reported similarity is
# therefore a LOWER BOUND — the real resemblance can be higher, never lower.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.80          # a block is kept while at least this share of its lines match
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_GAP = 3        # ...and while no more than this many differ back to back
MIN_BLOCK_LINES = 6            # nothing shorter than this is worth a human's attention

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A BLOCK MUST SAY SOMETHING. C# is punctuation-heavy — `}`, `else`, `catch`, `{`, `});` — and a
# run of those matches a run of those anywhere else in the codebase. An audit of one run found
# SIX reported "duplicates" with no statement in them at all; the worst was nine lines of
#     }  catch  {  return false;  }
# which is not duplication, it is the shape of the language. A line counts as substantive when
# it is long enough to carry a statement AND contains an identifier followed by a call, an
# assignment or a member access. Raise this to 3 or 4 for a stricter report: measured on this
# repository, 2 drops 31 findings, 3 drops 88, 4 drops 156.

        5 files in this repository have one. Every newline inside a comment or a literal is

    OUTPUT 2 — for a machine. Maximum signal per byte; no concession to human readability.

    Four deliberate savings over the obvious encoding, measured on this repository:
      1. FILE PATHS ARE INTERNED. Paths are long and repeat on nearly every record. They are
         listed ONCE in the header's `files` array and referenced afterwards by integer index.
      2. NO `"t":"dup"` TAG. Line 1 is the header; every other line is a finding. A per-record
         type tag would be 470 copies of a fact the line number already establishes.
      3. NO CODE BODIES. The code is on disk at the coordinates given. Shipping it again would
         multiply the file size for zero information — this is the single biggest saving.
      4. SIDES ARE ARRAYS, NOT OBJECTS. `[fileIndex, firstLine, lastLine]` beats
         `{"f":..,"s":..,"e":..}` on every record, and the header declares the order.

    The header carries `record` and `files` so the format is self-describing: an agent never has
    to guess a key, and nothing here needs this docstring to be decoded.
